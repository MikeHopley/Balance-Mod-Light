<h1>FTL Balance Mod <span class="light-heading">Light</span>
<span class="subtitle">by Mike Hopley</span></h1>

<p>Balance Mod Light is my custom version of <a href="http://www.it-is-law.com/ftl-balance/index.php?title=Main_Page">Twinge’s Balance Mod</a>. It reverts some changes for an experience that is closer to Vanilla FTL.</p>

<p>I’ve erred towards making the game harder rather than easier.</p>

<p><strong>This is very new, so it’s possible I messed something up.</strong></p>


<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

<p class="download">Download: <a href="#">Balance Mod Light 1.0</a> <strong>NOT YET AVAILABLE</strong></p>

<p>This is not a standalone mod. In <a href="https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17102">Slipstream Mod Manager</a>, you need both mods enabled, and Balance Mod Light must be loaded <strong>after</strong> Twinge’s Balance Mod.</p>

<p>The current version is designed for Balance Mod 3.6, but should work fine with other versions too.</p>

<h2 id="motive">Motivation</h2>

<h3>Why Balance Mod?</h3>

<p>What I want from Balance Mod is a more enjoyable, varied, and nuanced version of FTL.</p>

<p>Balance Mod makes trash items more usable, often just by reducing their cost. Importantly, this also reduces sale value.</p>

<p>Increased Flak 1 and Halberd rarity means they carry fewer runs. Increased hacking costs and removal of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZXUAaZSCQ&t=37s">the bypass</a> make hacking a less complete “win button”.</p>

<p>Balance Mod also applies polish, care, and craftsmanship. I appreciate the small details.</p>


<h3>Why Balance Mod <em>Light</em>?</h3>

<p>What I <strong>don’t</strong> want from Balance Mod are changes designed to make the game less harsh or reduce the effect of <abbr title="Random Number Generation">RNG</abbr>. When I play a win streak, I want to feel sure I’ve earned it.</p>

<p>This mod was prompted by some changes in Balance Mod 3.6. When an endgame Auto-scout runs out of ammo after firing twin Letos three times, I feel there has been too much meddling.</p>

<p>In other words: I’m something of a purist, but I enjoy Balance Mod more than Vanilla. This mod is my attempt at squaring that circle.</p>


<h2 id="bugs">Bug fixes and graphical changes</h2>

<p>My bug fixes are also available in a <a href="https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=35599">standalone mod.</a></p>

<p>Balance Mod already incorporates my Heavy Ion Stunner graphic, and my graphical fixes for the Hull Beam and Beam Drone 2.</p>

<p>I fixed a graphical glitch with the reactor bar, when using Zoltan C.</p>

<p>I fixed the <a href="https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Unarmed_Defector">Rebel Defector event</a>, so you can never tell whether it’s a trap.</p>


<h2 id="changes">Changes from Balance Mod</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, every change is a reversion to Vanilla behaviour.</p>

<h3>Sector 1</h3>

<p>Auto-assaults can appear in sector 1.</p>
<p class="rationale">It seems overkill to exclude an entire class of ships, just to help Stealth B and C.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_AI_Scout_carrying_Shield_Virus">Rebel Shield Hack event</a> is the same as Vanilla:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It can appear in sector 1.</li>
	<li>It cannot appear in Rebel sectors.</li>
	<li>Instead of hacking one bar, it halves the shield level.</li>
</ul>
<p class="rationale">Yes, the event is utter RNG trash. But that’s part of variety and I like having a scare from time to time. Rebel Sectors on the other hand don’t need a nerf.</p>


<h3>Events</h3>

<p><a href="https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Zoltan_Fight_With_Boarders">Zoltan Border Police</a> are fully staffed again (+1 boarder).</p>
<p class="rationale">Don’t mess with the border police. This is supposed to be a scary event.</p>

<p>The default crew kill reward set is the same as Vanilla.</p>
<p class="rationale">It feels bad for crew kills to have a 40% chance (up from 33%) of being identical to destroying the ship. Shifting the low scrap/free crew reward into medium/high scrap means more scrap in total. These numbers are fundamental and should not be altered lightly.</p>


<h3>Systems</h3>

<p>Hacking system price reduced to 120 (from 130, Vanilla is 80).</p>
<p class="rationale">It can be important to buy hacking early, especially for Stealth B. Pushing the initial price too high moves it strategically closer to cloaking, which is usually too expensive to afford in the early&ndash;mid game. This is even more relevant for some of the hardest challenge runs. Having it priced the same as shields feels about right.</p>


<h3>Weapons</h3>

<p>Heavy Ion Stunner charge time returned to 13 (from 12).</p>
<p class="rationale">It can’t self-stack without a Reloader, for an authentic Engi B experience. Enemy Heavy Ion + Halberd is a much more precise dodge.</p>

<p>Heavy Ion Stunner stun increased to 10 seconds (from 7, Vanilla is 3).</p>
<p class="rationale">The stun gives it more personality and clever uses. Stun is underused, and giving a strong stun to an otherwise weak weapon is interesting.</p>

<p>Halberd Beam charge time returned to 17 seconds (from 18).</p>
<p class="rationale">3 power is enough to separate Halberd from Pike and Hull. Slower Halberds mostly harm enemies, not the player.</p>

<p>Burst Laser 3 charge time returned to 19 seconds (from 18).</p>
<p class="rationale">Honestly, I just think it’s cool that you can cloak two unmanned volleys in a row. I’m only using this weapon when desperate anyway (or with a pre-igniter), so -1 second charge is not going to change decisions.</p>

<p>Hull Laser 2 speed returned to 90 (from 75).</p>
<p class="rationale">I can time my weapons, it’s not that hard. The faster speed gives this weapon just a touch more personality.</p>

<p>Flak 1 radius returned to 42 (from 49).</p>
<p class="rationale">Nerfing multiple Flak 1 setups isn’t necessary when the rarity is higher. Reduced Flak 1 accuracy makes Flak 2 less distinct. Inaccurate flak harms enemies more than the player; flak and Swarm are the only enemy weapons that can land multiple shots in the same room.</p>

<p>Adv. Flak radius returned to 40 (from 45), and charge time to 8 (from 9).</p>
<p class="rationale">The changes are ineffective at nerfing Lanius B, and it’s fun to have the weapon be more distinct.</p>


<h3>Augments</h3>

<p>Adv. FTL Navigation reinstated. It costs 20 instead of 50 (Vanilla).</p>
<p class="rationale">It has occasional use for diving and a fun blue option. Make it cheap so at least you might keep a free one.</p>

<p>Hacking Stun reinstated. It costs 20 instead of 60 (Vanilla).</p>
<p class="rationale">Although rarely useful, it’s fun sometimes. Make it cheap so at least you might keep a free one.</p>

<p>Long-Ranged Scanners cost 40 (50 in Balance Mod, 30 in Vanilla).</p>
<p class="rationale">At 30 scrap it’s great value, but not the auto-buy people think. At 50 scrap I almost never buy it. 40 scrap means I will buy it sometimes. Note that LRS blue options are slightly weaker in Balance Mod.</p>


<h3>Player ships</h3>

<p>Stealth B cloaking room is below sensors.</p>
<p class="rationale">Moving the cloaking room above sensors was a pure anti-RNG change, specifically for Mini Beam and Beam Drone 2. It made the combination of repairs, <50% venting, sensor dashes, and power-stealing awkward; and also made it harder to judge whether enemy drones were targeting a critical room.</p>


<h3>Enemy ships</h3>

<p>Enemy ship missile stocks returned to Vanilla amounts.
<p class="rationale">Reducing the stock of missiles on several ships from 10 to 6 is a significant anti-RNG change.</p>

<p>Enemy ship names restored.</p>
<p class="rationale">The name changes were a consequence of the missile stock changes. Changing “Energy” to “Zoltan” is good though, so I kept that.</p>

<p>Some enemies can occasionally have 5 shields.</p>
<p class="rationale">This also means they can get 2 shields in sector 2, or 3 shields in sector 3. That’s a problem. I like the game giving me problems.</p>

<p>Some big Slug ships can have 8 crew.</p>
<p class="rationale">Why not? It’s more variety.</p>

<p>Lanius Bomber engines and cloaking increased to Vanilla strength.
<p class="rationale">Lanius Bombers are scary. I like that.</p>

<p>Rock Aggressors can have level 2 cloaking.</p>
<p class="rationale">Long cloaks and missiles are rough, but that’s part of the game.</p>

<p>Small Zoltan ships’ hull returned to 7 (from 6).
<p class="rationale">This change seemed unnecessary. It could cause Stealth B rather silly problems, as this enemy can run at 4 hull.</p>

<p>Shieldless Auto-scouts/surveyors can occur at any point in the game.</p>
<p class="rationale">While it’s reasonable to make late-game enemies slightly harder, I think it’s more fun to keep the variety. Honestly, who doesn’t enjoy shieldless Auto-scouts with bonkers weapons, max cloaking, and 45% evasion?</p>

<p>Smaller enemy ships can appear in later sectors.</p>
<p class="rationale">Cutting out these layouts early is one way to make the late-game slightly harder, but I prefer having more variety. I’ve kept the enemy buffs, however (except the one that forces shields on all auto-ships).</p>
