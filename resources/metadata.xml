<![CDATA[
	This mod reverts some of Twinge's changes from the Balance Mod. The intention is to keep all the fun and interesting parts of Balance Mod, but stay closer to vanilla in other respects. Notably this mod does NOT aim to reduce the influence of RNG.

	This mod must be loaded AFTER Balance Mod. It is not a standalone mod.

	<!--
		Suggestions for the description...

		Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship, how
		does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

		Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

		Optionally list important features.

		List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or requirements.

		Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
			Kestrel-A, Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Zoltan-A,
			Stealth-A, Rock-A,    Slug-A,    Mantis-A,
			Lanius-A,  Crystal-A

		Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
		that again for each new version.
